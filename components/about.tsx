        <p>Before university, I started my journey with <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, designing websites and gradually learning <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>PHP</strong> to add more functionality. I later transitioned to <strong>WordPress</strong> as a website designer, collaborating with experts on <strong>performance optimization</strong>, <strong>SEO</strong>, and <strong>content creation</strong>. However, my true passion is <strong>programming</strong>, and Iâ€™m now focused on leveraging <strong>cutting-edge technologies</strong> and <strong>AI</strong> to improve my work and solve real-world problems.</p>

      <p>
        <p><span className="italic">When I'm not coding</span>, I enjoy playing video games, playing football, and reading management books to enhance my <span className="font-medium">soft skills</span> like leadership, time management, and communication. I believe in balancing technical expertise with personal growth and staying curious about new opportunities.</p>
